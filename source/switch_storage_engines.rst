Switching Storage Engines
================================================================================

By default, |PSMDB| runs with WiredTiger_.  There is also the original MMAPv1_
storage engine, as well as an optional :ref:`inmemory` storage engine to choose
from. Each storage engine is designed for specific purposes and workloads.

You can select a storage engine using the ``--storageEngine`` command-line
option when you start ``mongod``.  Alternatively, you can set the
``storage.engine`` variable in the configuration file (by default,
:file:`/etc/mongod.conf`).

Data created by one storage engine is not compatible
with other storage engines, because each one has its own data model.
When changing the storage engine, you have to do one of the following:

- If you simply want to temporarily test a storage engine,
  you can change to a different data directory
  using the ``--dbpath`` command-line option:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ service mongod stop
     $ mongod --storageEngine inmemory --dbpath <dataDirForInMemory>

  .. note::

     Make sure that the user running :program:`mongod` has read and
     write permissons for the new data directory.

- If you want to permanently switch to a different storage engine
  and do not have any valuable data in your database,
  clean out the default data directory
  and edit the configuration file:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ service mongod stop
     $ rm -rf /var/lib/mongodb/*
     $ sed -i '/engine: .*inMemory/s/#//g' /etc/mongod.conf 
     $ service mongod start

- If there is data that you want to migrate and make compatible with the new
  storage engine, use the ``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore`` utilities:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ mongodump --out <dumpDir>
     $ service mongod stop
     $ rm -rf /var/lib/mongodb/*
     $ sed -i '/engine: .*inMemory/s/#//g' /etc/mongod.conf
     $ service mongod start
     $ mongorestore <dumpDir>

Storage Engine Configuration Templates
================================================================================

The default configuration file provided with |PSMDB| (:file:`/etc/mongod.conf`)
contains templates for running any of the bundled storage engine.  The suggested
values do not cover all cases, but they are a good reference point to start
customizing the configuration.  The following hints may help you:

- On very high volume systems, you may need to increase the maximum number of
  concurrent transactions for WiredTiger_ and :ref:`inmemory` (default is 128).
  These are controlled using the following MongoDB parameters:

  - ``wiredTigerConcurrentReadTransactions``
  - ``wiredTigerConcurrentWriteTransactions``

- On systems with more than roughly 24,000 collections running MMAPv1_,
  increase the ``storage.mmapv1.nsSize`` variable.

- Also for MMAPv1_ you can set ``storage.mmapv1.smallFiles`` to ``true`` to use
  a smaller default file size, if you have a large number of databases that each
  holds a small amount of data.


- The default maximum internal cache size that WiredTiger_ uses
  is the larger of either:

  - 50% of RAM minus 1 GB
  - 256 MB

.. $The ``storage.rocksdb.counters`` variable must be set to ``true``
.. $if you are running :ref:`mongorocks`
.. $and want to use `Percona Monitoring and Management
