Installing from Percona Repositories
================================================================================

It is recommended to install |PSMDB| from official Percona repositories:

|tip.run-all.root|

1. Fetch the repository packages from Percona web: :bash:`wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.$(lsb_release -sc)_all.deb`
#. Install the downloaded package with :program:`dpkg`: :bash:`dpkg -i
   percona-release_latest.$(lsb_release -sc)_all.deb` Once you install this
   package the |Percona| repositories should be added. You can check the
   repository setup in the :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/percona-release.list`
   file.
#. Enable the repository: :bash:`percona-release enable psmdb-40 release`
#. Remember to update the local cache: |apt.update|
#. Install the |PSMDB| package: :bash:`apt install percona-server-mongodb`

Using Percona Server for MongoDB
================================================================================

By default, |PSMDB| stores data files in :file:`/var/lib/mongodb/`
and configuration parameters in :file:`/etc/mongod.conf`.

|tip.run-all.root|

Starting the service
  |PSMDB| is started automatically after installation
  unless it encounters errors during the installation process.
  You can also manually start it using the following command:
  |service.mongod.start|

Confirming that service is running**
  Check the service status using the following command:
  |service.mongod.status|

Stopping the service
  Stop the service using the following command: |service.mongod.stop|

Restarting the service
  Restart the service using the following command: |service.mongod.restart|

.. note::

   On Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 and later versions you can also invoke all the
   above commands with ``sytemctl`` instead of ``service``.

Uninstalling Percona Server for MongoDB
================================================================================

To uninstall |PSMDB|, remove all the installed packages. Removing packages with
|apt.remove| will leave the configuration and data files. Removing the packages
with |apt.purge| will remove all the packages with configuration files and data.
Depending on your needs you can choose which command better suits you.

|tip.run-all.root|

1. Stop the |mongod| server: |service.mongod.stop|
#. Remove the packages. There are two options. To keep the configuration and
   data files, run |apt.remove.percona-server-mongodb|. If you want to delete
   the configuration and data files as well as the packages, use |apt.purge|:
   |apt.purge.percona-server-mongodb|
