Before upgrading your production |PSMDB| deployments, test all your applications
in a testing environment to make sure they are compatible with the new version.

data and configuration files are preserved) includes the following steps:

1. Stop the :program:`mongod` instance
#. Remove old packages
#. Install new packages
#. Start the :program`mongod` instance

It is recommended to upgrade |PSMDB| from official Percona repositories using
the corresponding package manager for your system.  For more information, see
